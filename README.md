Toggle sensor turns the sensor on and off.
Accelerometer and gyroscope readings are real time and displayed to two decimal places. This can be changed to a larger number of significant figures in the code.
Graphs are updated as sensor readings are updated. Top graph is accelerometer and bottom is gyroscope. This graph can be considered 'dynamic' as it moves in accordance to new data. However, it is actually a static graph continuosly deleted and recreated as the sensor data changes/each time it is collected.
Sensor reading has a frequency of 14Hz.
